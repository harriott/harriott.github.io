[FFmpeg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg) is what got me, back in 2014, into the austere power of the command-line. I use just a small part of it's vast abilities - mostly just to compress videos, crop away unwanted borders, trim away unwanted lengths, remove the sound... I sometimes do fancy stuff like watermarking or changing a clips default playback speed.

For `Windows` I grab the `7z` from [FFmpeg Builds](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) and `cpi ffmpeg.exe $Env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\WindowsApps` so's I can access it from anywhere in `PowerShell`.

[mpv (media player)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpv_%28media_player%29) is the biz on `Linux` - minimalist and keyboard controlled - I love it.

[OBS Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBS_Studio) is excellent, and can record anything that's passing through your machine.

[OpenShot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShot_Video_Editor) is glitchy, so I only use it for extremely simple and short edits.

I keep [VLC media player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLC_media_player) on my `Windows` system because it's so functional.
