## the push
I followed a typical path:

1. desktops and laptops that came with `Microsoft Windows` installed
1. Building my own machine - what OS to use? Oh, I'll try `Ubuntu`. Works well!
1. Minor frustrations with `Ubuntu` configurations. Aha, its derivative `Linux Mint` is much better!

Then, the final realisations:

1. so often when I seek answers to a Linux question the `Arch Linux` wiki comes to the rescue
1. the `Debian` upstream has a rare limitation - in my case, in 2015, it was `Debian` being stuck on an old version of `lippng` ([TeX Live news: 2013 frozen, 2014 pretest, 2014 Debian](http://www.preining.info/blog/2014/04/tex-live-news-2013-frozen-2014-pretest-2014-debian/)), which percolated some limitation that I've now forgotten down into `Linux Mint`

So the jump to `Arch Linux`.

## Oh wow, It takes days and days...
My first `Arch` install took weeks. It was winter, I had no heating and no work, and I plunged in. Inbetween morning runs alone by the river and evenings by my friend's log fire, I learned how to install `Arch`, and loved it. I could've installed it much quicker than I did, but I wanted my install to be repeatable, so I worked at semi-automating what I was doing. Several years and a dozen installs later, I still install slowly because I still take time to improve my understanding of what I'm doing - of `Bash`, of `Unix` utilities, and of the many hidden components that make up a useable `Linux` system.

## and it doesn't get any better than this
I could install `Linux Mint` with a useable desktop environment in an hour or two, and I could live with the frustration of not being able to easily tweak it to my preferences, but I prefer spending the time to install `Arch` exactly how I want it, benefitting too from the excellent software repositories.

Apart from buying into Apple's walled garden, as all my non-techy artist friends do for good reason, I can't see how I could get any better OS than what I have with my minimalist CLI-heavy `Arch` installs.
