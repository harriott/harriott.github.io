A quick run through what I use on my Android phones.

- [Amazon Shopping](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.mShop.android.shopping) - another astoundingly well-made app
- [CalenGoo - Calendar and Tasks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.calengoo.android) is an excellent alternative
- [Dropsync: Autosync for Dropbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync) is essential for me, and the developer's right on the ball.
- [F-Droid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid) allows me to install a few useful packages that `Google Play` doesn't help with, such as `Termux`
- [JBL Headphones](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jbl.stc.com) - gets them setup...
- [leboncoin, petites annonces](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.leboncoin) works well right through the purchase
- [OpenWeatherMap](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.openweather) - excellent!
- Poweramp ([Home](https://powerampapp.com/)) is my preferred music player
- [Doctolib](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.doctolib.www) works beautifully

## file management
- [File Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alphainventor.filemanager) appears as `File Manager +`. I make some bookmarks of folders that contain images that I'd like to swipe through.
- I use [Total Commander - file manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghisler.android.TotalCommander) many times a day.
- my Android phones have large storage full of most of my personal files - many GB's - Dropsync'd in from my computers

### Termux
- [Termux](https://termux.com/) is astoundingly useful. It gives me a `Bash` terminal in my `Android` phones, with full access to my files. My installation is always evolving, including my [OS-Android-Termux / bash_profile](https://github.com/harriott/OS-Android-Termux/blob/master/bash_profile).
    - apps that I install: `bat`, `clifm`, `exa`, `fd`, `fzf`, `neofetch`, `nnn`, `ripgrep`, `tree`

## document management
- [Adobe Acrobat Reader: Edit PDF](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.reader) - my preferred reader, inspite of its repeatedly reminding me of features I don't want
- [HP Smart](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hp.printercontrol) for accessing my lovely old `HP ENVY 5532`

## email clients
- [Gmail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm) is damned good, if you're happy to be known inside out...
- [K-9 Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-9_Mail) - I use to access my `FastMail`, `GMX Mail`, and `Zourit` accounts.

## entering text
- [Gboard - the Google Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin) includes a clipboard
- [Hacker's Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard) - I use occasionally
- [Keepass2Android Offline](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android_nonet) - works perfectly with my password database (`JH.kdbx`) mostly created in a web browser configured with [KeePassXC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePassXC)

## instant messaging
[WhatsApp Messenger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp) is excellent, if you're happy to be known inside-out by [Meta Platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms)...

### Messages by Google
- from a browser, [Messages](https://messages.google.com/) works well, but a screen-scrape of the conversation won't show the senders...
- [Messages by Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging&hl=en) the default Android xMS app

## internetworking
- [Bouygues Telecom](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.bouyguestelecom.ecm.android) works well enough for checking my French phone contract

## languages

- [Google Translate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.translate) I use everyday...
