title: "minimalist and free audio tools"

Yeah, I use [FFmpeg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg) for pulling out audio streams or converting them on any system, and I use [mpv (media player)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpv_%28media_player%29) to check out individual audio files on linux.

I mostly listen to my music via [cmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmus). For the curious, my configurations begin in [$OSAB/bs-symlinks/jo-0.sh](https://github.com/harriott/OS-ArchBuilds/blob/master/bs-symlinks/jo-0.sh).
