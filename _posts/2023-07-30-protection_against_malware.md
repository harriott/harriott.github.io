Prudence is essential, with some analytical tools including [Clam AntiVirus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clam_AntiVirus).

On my `Linux` boxes, I occasionally do
```bash
clamscan -r 2>&1 | tee clamscan.log
```

`Windows`: Back in 2015 I was paying for my annual anti-malware subscription with [Kaspersky Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab). After that I decided to just rely on [Windows Security app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/security/operating-system-security/system-security/windows-defender-security-center/windows-defender-security-center).
