How I manage to browse the big old [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web).

For getting things done:

- [Firefox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox) is the man - independent, prone to crashing pages, otherwise solid.
    - `Ctrl+p > Destination > Save to PDF > Save` formats any full web page into a PDF to keep locally.
- [Google Chrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome) is damned good, maybe better, but it's owned...
    - I can sync open tabs from my Android phones, which is handy.
- [Microsoft Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge) is good enough for me on my `Windows 10 Pro` laptop.

Noteworthy plugins are:

- [KeePassXC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeePassXC) - oh wow, my passwords completely under my control! I keep my database in a directory that `Dropbox` sync's across machines.
- [OneTab](http://www.one-tab.com/) - so, so handy. Rarely it fails to open, which is always fixed by disabling and re-enabling it.
- [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin) - useful, but I turn it off for sites that I admire, so's they can earn
- [Tab-Session-Manager](https://github.com/sienori/Tab-Session-Manager) - a backup when for some reason I can't use `OneTab`

I go to the trouble of keeping my tabs sync'd across browsers...

For those occasions when I want to fire up an unconfigured browser, I use these:

- on `Linux`: [Falkon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkon)
- on `Windows`: [Opera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_%28web_browser%29)
