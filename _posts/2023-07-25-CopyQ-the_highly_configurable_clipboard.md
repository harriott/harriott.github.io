[CopyQ](http://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/) is a indispensable. In it I keep a general clipboard of recent text chunks that I copied and then probably pasted somewhere, but I also have some tabs of personal clipping - things that I often need such as my addresses.

I launch it from my [$machBld/jo/awesome/rc.lua](https://github.com/harriott/OS-ArchBuilds/blob/master/mb-AsusW202/jo/awesome/autorun.sh) and my [$Obc/autostart/autostart](https://github.com/harriott/OS-ArchBuilds/blob/master/jo/wm/Openbox/openbox/autostart/autostart), and I configure it as shown in [$OSAB/softwares.txt](https://github.com/harriott/OS-ArchBuilds/blob/master/softwares.txt), which includes a reference to my [$ABjo/wm/CopyQ/readyforPasting.ini](https://github.com/harriott/OS-ArchBuilds/blob/master/jo/wm/CopyQ/readyforPasting.ini).

I also have my [$Obc/rc/fixCopyQ.sh](https://github.com/harriott/OS-ArchBuilds/blob/master/jo/wm/Openbox/openbox/rc/fixCopyQ.sh), just incase.
