title: "some coding languages I use"
---

## Past, and I've forgotten...
- [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) - back in high school, I wrote an unbeatable [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) program.
- [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) - I used long ago, when I was a research acoustician.
- [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_%28programming_language%29) - I used in my appallingly badly written Master's thesis.

## Now, and I'm competent!
- [Bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) - yeah! - [bashrc](https://github.com/harriott/OS-ArchBuilds/blob/master/jo/Bash/bashrc)
- [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) - for nicely formatted documents: a book I'm working on, business cards, educational resources, foldable flyers, letters, poems, team schedules...
- [Perl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) - for complex text manipulations like this [digraphsTidy.pl](https://github.com/harriott/vimfiles/blob/master/digraphsTidy.pl) or this [nmsh-sort.pl](https://github.com/harriott/OS-ArchBuilds/blob/master/jo/clm/notmuch/nmsh-sort.pl)
- [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) - I've been using for years to script on `Microsoft Windows` machines - [PSProfile.ps1](https://github.com/harriott/OS-MSWin10/blob/master/PSProfile.ps1)
- [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) - for file management, such as [FM-DirLVF](https://github.com/harriott/FM-DirLVF).
- `vimscript`, an integral part of [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29#Vim_script), and not wanted anywhere else in the whole wide world - I'm slightly competent, as evidenced by my ever-evolving [vimfiles](https://github.com/harriott/vimfiles)

## Now, but I'm incompetent...
- [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29) - I barely use, what little I need for [Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_%28software%29)
