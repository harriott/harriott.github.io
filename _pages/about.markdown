Self-taught geekology: Taking the time to go faster.

I love `Arch Linux`, `Bash`, `Vim`, `LaTeX`, `Python`, `FFmpeg`, `ImageMagick` and in general wrangling stuff from the command-line.

I also keep up with `PowerShell` on my `Windows 10 Pro` laptop, and I use `Markdown`, `Dokuwiki`, and `Pandoc` daily.
