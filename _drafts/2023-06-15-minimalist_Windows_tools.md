I used to find `Microsoft Windows` lengthy to setup well and to maintain in good order. It's become easier, and `Windows 10` is particularly easy to manage. Being a desktop environment, it comes with a lot of what we might need. Here I run through some minimalist tools that I use to fill in a few gaps:


- [AutoHotkey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoHotkey) - [ $MSwin10\jo.ahk ](https://github.com/harriott/OS-MSWin10/blob/master/jo.ahk) is invaluable!
- [Bulk Rename](http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/) for fast renaming of many files
- [CapsLock](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/capslock/9nbx19w2pp00) gets me a tray icon, which I need on my `Lenovo ThinkPad T430 i5-3320M` which has no LED indicator...
- `ctrl+shift+esc` = `Task Manager`, which I set to show `Processes` and hide when minimized - very handy
- [Ditto](http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net) is my preferred clipboard, invaluable to my workflow
