Being cheap, I manage images on my various machines with a range of free tools, briefly described here.

- [GNU Image Manipulation Program.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP) can do anything, if you can figure it out, which I can't. Still I've found it handy to crop an image to a specific aspect ratio.
- [ExifTool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExifTool) - I mostly use to remove the highly inconsistent orientation tag from images - see my [jpgorhor](https://github.com/harriott/jpgorhor).
- on Linux
    - [feh (image viewer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feh_%28image_viewer%29)
        - `feh -F -D 4` full screen slide-show, changing every 4 seconds.
- on Windows
    - [FastStone Image Viewer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastStone_Image_Viewer) I use as my default
        - I always `F12 (= Settings) > Viewer > [ Loop on, Auto-rotate by EXIF off, Default Unit > cm ]`
