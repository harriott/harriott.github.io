A quick run through what I use on my Android phones.

## document management
- [HP Smart](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hp.printercontrol) for accessing my lovely old `HP ENVY 5532`

## email clients
- [Gmail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm) is damned good, if you're happy to be known inside out...
- [K-9 Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-9_Mail) - I use to access my `FastMail`, `GMX Mail`, and `Zourit` accounts.
